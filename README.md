# CLiCK v2 - Control Analog devices with MIDI
The CLiCK v2 is a tiny 3 in/3 out USB MIDI Interface & relay switcher for adding wired or wireless MIDI Control
to amp channels, control ports, expression pedal jacks, and other auxiliary controls on any kind of music or
effects device.

# Updating Firmware
To update your CLiCK v2, use our [web updater](https://update.piratemidi.com). 

If you have trouble updating, please make sure the 9v power is plugged in. If you continue to have issues, a manual firmware recovery may be required. You will find instructions for a manual firmware recovery in PDF format on [this support page](https://learn.piratemidi.com/downloads/troubleshooting).

# Device Capabilities and Overview

## Relays
One TRS ¼” jack has solid state relays for the Tip and for the Ring, which means with a
Split-Y cable, you can control 2 devices that use TS cables for external switch control.
Some common favourites for relay control include:
- Guitar amplifiers
- Strymon Fave switch substitute
- Delay pedals with tap tempo switch inputs
- Pedals with external switch support (e.g. JHS Red Remote)
- Pedal with aux switch inputs

## Expression Control
Control non-MIDI expression pedal jacks on your pedals with a digitally controlled potentiometer that mimics the movement of a real expression pedal. Control the position of the expression with MIDI Control Change messages. Preset the position per preset using our web editor - now your analog expression jack has presets!

## Wireless MIDI Control
Bluetooth and WiFi can be toggled (one or the other) using the [web editor](https://edit.piratemidi.com). RTP MIDI over WiFi (Apple MIDI), and Bluetooth MIDI options give you wireless freedom for sending MIDI to your pedalboard with your phone, tablet, or computer. 

## USB MIDI Interface
Use the onboard 3.5mm TRS MIDI jacks to interface with serial MIDI gear and USB MIDI. Send MIDI from your DAW to your pedalboard using CLiCK v2 as the gateway. The MIDI Out jack is switchable between TRS Type A, TRS Type B, and Aux Switch input (for changing presets) at the tap of a button with the web editor.
